* TODO What parameters are required NSGA-II?
  - pop size (multiples of 4)
  - # of generations
  - # of objectives
  - # of constraints
  - # of real variables with lower and upper limits of each
  - Probability of crossover of real variable? (0.6-1.0)
  - probability of mutation 1/nreal
  - distribution index for crossover
* TODO fix error calculation
* TODO decide on the units to be used throughout the app
* TODO implement some measures
  - [ ] robust
  - [ ] energy efficiency
  - [ ] stability
  - [ ] drag
  - [ ] eccentricity of path
* TODO add labels to legends in gnuplot output.
* TODO Gosh, do I want to somehow just use Mathematica here?
    
** What should the Scheme interface look like?
   Limit it to a real valued search.
   (nsga-ii-search fitness-function #:objective-count 2 
                                    #:gene-count 10

** What is required for a robot?
   bodies
   joints
   controller-fn
   sensor-fn

   What should be swappable?

   robot has bodies and joints

   (controller-fn robot (sensor-fn robot))
   
* What's a better way to handle OSC updates?
  (make <osc-registry> #:host host #:port port)
  (osc-register reg path getter setter)
  (osc-push reg)
  (osc-pull reg)
